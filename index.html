									<h2>Data Privacy</h2>
									<h3><b>Importance of Data</b></h3>
									<p>Why data privacy is important? Data plays an important role in our lives. Most people think the notion of data is irrelevant to their  lives therefore they do not pay attention to protect themselves from scammers. The truth is not so. Data can be collected easily. Even a simple online shopping action or a single click on a trap link is enough for scammers to collect your data. Collected data are of great value to companies. As there are many ways to deal with it, such as selling them to companies or using them to access your personal information. There is no limit to it and it is very dangerous in the wrong hands.<br><p></p>

									So how can you protect your data? There are multiple ways, to begin with, Set a unique password on your network and email accounts, do not share your data with unreliable sites, apps and companies. <br><p></p>

									The easiest way to protect yourself is to set a strong password. Choose a password that can not be easily deciphered. Which means when setting your password, choose things that are not directly related to you, such as your middle name, date of birth or social security number. Make sure to include symbols, upper and lower case letters. Change your password several times and do not use the same password in multiple places. <br><p></p>

									No matter how careful you are, companies keeping your data may not be as careful as you are. For example; recently, a company in Turkey called "Yemek Sepeti", has suffered a massive loss of users because they have had their customerâ€™s data stolen. Such problems greatly affect the relations of companies with their customers as expected. <br><p></p>

									Phishing scams use a variety of techniques to steal your data. There are many different types of phishing scams out there but you can avoid them by learning how to spot them. Never open emails or attachments from unknown senders and don't click on risky links in weird emails to prevent becoming a victim of a phishing scam. Avoid emails that contain unexpected work and money, as these emails are mostly fake and sent by scammers to steal your valuable data. <br><p></p>

									Consequently, protecting our data and privacy is in our hands. If we use strong passwords, if we pay attention to the companies we share our data with, we would be much safer against phishing scams.<h5>This article written by Emre Karamahmut</h5>
